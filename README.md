# My contribution:

The solar panel design is created using Fusion 360, a powerful design software known for its advanced modeling capabilities. This step involves conceptualizing the panel's structure, dimensions, and arrangement of components to maximize solar energy absorption and minimize aerodynamic drag.
Once the design is complete, the next step involves importing the model into Workbench, a CFD simulation software renowned for its robust analysis capabilities. Here, the panel's geometry is meshed and configured to simulate fluid flow and heat transfer phenomena around and through the panel. Also, the software allows to calculate the applied forces on the panel and test its limits which later led to find the ideal tilt with the least stresses.
After obtaining results from Workbench, the data are further analyzed and interpreted using Edupack, a software suite designed for materials selection and analysis. In this stage, the structural integrity of the panel materials, their thermal properties, and their compatibility with environmental conditions are evaluated to ensure optimal performance and durability.
